# Best Practices


## Add a Git Ignore file

```
Some files should always be shared
But for others, fellow devs should be spared
So hide them from git
before you commit
cuz it tells the devs that you cared
```

Git Ignore is a file that allows you to hide certains files and directories,
whose names match a pattern, to prevent them from being added to Git. There are
several reasons why you might want to not add certain files to your repository.

## Add a project README

```
Tell them how you're gonna help
Tell them what they want to know
Show them how they can help
Show them where to go
Help them learn what's coming
Help them learn what's so
```

## Separate your concerns: logic, content, and style

```
Separate your concerns
and you'll be better off
for if you fail to do so
fellow coders will scoff
This also leads to better code
resilient and more robust
separate logic, content, and style
and in your code we'll trust
```
