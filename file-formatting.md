# Formatting Files

## Reformat file to coding standard

```
I used the coding standard and my IDE
and formatted code automatically 
to shift things around
and align them a bit
to increase it's quality
```

a humorous version

```
I used the coding standard
to shift things around a bit
To format and align them
for readability
so the coders don't quit
```

or in homage to Lord of the Rings  

```
One standard to format them all, one standard to align them,
One standard to bring them all and in the codebase mind them.
```

## Move HTML and JS to separate files

```
Standing on their own
They each become stronger, then
brought back together
```

In legacy applications, the HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS are often in the same file as the program logic. Separating them into their own files, makes them easier to edit, less fragile, and it's better for collaboration.  

```
PHP, markup, JavaScript
and cascading styles
all need a home
each in their own files

Simpler to edit, read
and understand what changed
one won't affect the other
when things get rearranged
```

## Remove Commented Code

Commenting out blocks of code only makes the code worse. You don't need to
"save it for later".  Version control systems are good at remembering what was
changed and by who.  Commenting out blocks of code is unnecessary.

```
blocks of code commented out
obscuring the running code
forcing you to concentrate
increasing mental load

remove the code
if you aren't sure
to keep code clean
so it may endure
```

## Remove Dead Code

Dead code that which runs, but is never used.  It consuming resources, without
adding value.  It provides the opportunity to introduce bugs, and cause errors.
The best thing to do is to remove it.

```
good code does what's needed
yet leaves room to be improved
Dead code only makes things worse
and is best when it is removed
```
