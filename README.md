# Poetic Commits

__There are those that say "Code is Poetry". This project is based on the idea that poetry has a place in commit messages too.__

A good commit message has a subject line, a blank line, then a description of 
why a things changed. It should have the following criteria:  

* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Write the subject line to sound like an authoritative command
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how


```
The subject line

This is a paragraph that describes what and why I made the changes. 
It can be as long as you need it to be. Just try not to duplicate 
what you wrote in the subject line, because it doesn't add any value.  
```

While that approach works, if you can add a little poetry into the 
purpose of your change, then *why not*? **This repo will help you do 
just that!** This table of content is organized by the types of changes 
that you're likely to make. Put these messages at the top of your body. 
If needed, add your more descriptive details below the poetry.

## Example

In each of these sections, The primary heading of the page reflects the
 name in the Table of Contents. The second level headings are the subject
 line of your commit message. Each of the pre-formatted blocks under the h2, are the descriptive part of the commit message.
