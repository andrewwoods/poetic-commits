## Initialize/Sanitize variables in \_SERVER + \_GET

```
Initialized the variables
for data from $_SERVER and $_GET
to ensure the data is clean
and a value is set
```

__Note:__ you should adapt the array names to the ones you use 


## Update deprecated mysql function calls to mysqli 

```
All code deprecates
mysql is gone now
that we have seven
```

__Note:__ the mysql extension was deprecated in 5.5, and removed in PHP 7.0

## Add Composer to project

```
Add composer.json to add packages and autoload
so the packages can be found by your code
Add composer.lock to verify the lot
so your team downloads the same as you've got
```

## I hacked Core, but just a little

WordPress, Drupal, and I'm sure a few others have a rule: "Don't Hack Core".

You really shouldn't "hack core". On occasion though, you have to.  So when it
happens, use this to recognize you're not supposed to and ask forgiveness from
your the future developer.

```
Don't Hack Core! I know!
that's what they say
Just this once! I said
and I did it anyway

It's just for now, I promise
It will get fixed later
but I still feel dirty
worse than if I followed Vader

So forgive me this tresspass
let us move on for now
I'm sure in a future release
it'll get fixed some how
```
